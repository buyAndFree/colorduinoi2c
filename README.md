## Colorduino via I2C

Original colorduino-i2c sketch was outdated and required modification to original libraries and/or a very early version of Arduino IDE  
This version will work without any modification (Colorduino libraries still required)  

Master goes on to the controlling arduino (e.g. UNO)  
Slave goes on to the colorduino board  

* Original code was obtained from [colorduino-i2c](https://code.google.com/archive/p/colorduino-i2c/)
